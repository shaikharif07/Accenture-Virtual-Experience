Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience

This repository contains the certificate and related materials for the Accenture virtual case experience that I successfully completed. The virtual experience, provided by Accenture, focused on various aspects of data analytics and visualization, encompassing project understanding, data cleaning and modeling, data visualization, and storytelling.


Project Tasks
Project Understanding: I gained a comprehensive understanding of the project objectives and requirements. Thorough research was conducted to identify key questions that needed to be addressed through data analysis.

Data Cleaning & Modeling: I performed essential data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and resolving inconsistencies. Additionally, I applied appropriate data modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, such as feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, or creating statistical models.

ata Visualization & Storytelling: Data visualization played a crucial role in presenting the analyzed data in a visually appealing and informative manner. I utilized data visualization tools and techniques to create insightful charts, graphs, and interactive visual representations. These visualizations were designed to effectively communicate trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.

Present to the Client: In the final phase, I prepared and delivered a comprehensive presentation to the client. The presentation showcased the data analysis process, highlighted key findings, and provided actionable recommendations based on the insights gained from the data. This involved effectively communicating the project objectives, the methodology used, the visualized results, and the potential business impact of the analysis.
